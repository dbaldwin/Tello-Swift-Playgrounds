**Goal:** Use Swift commands to make Tello fly in a straight line to a given coordinate.

The commands we learned in the last chapter can fly Tello anywhere you want.
But to fly to the diagonal point of a square, it takes 2 commands.
To fly to the diagonal point of a cube, it takes 3 commands. This wastes too much energy in space.

That's why we are introducing command `flyLine(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int)`.
By giving the target coordinate, or the relative distance from the current position to the target position,
we can make Tello fly a straight line to any point directly in space.

1. Place your Tello on a flat surface.
2. Make sure the battery level is above 20%.
3. Take off and fly a straight line to point (x:100, y:100, z:0)
4. Land when it's done.
5. Tap **Run My Code**.

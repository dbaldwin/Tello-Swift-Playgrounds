**Goal:** Use Swift commands to tell Tello to fly a curved line via two given coordinates.

Have you ever wondered whether Tello can fly in a curved line? The answer is yes, it can! 

Unlike other commands, you need to provide Tello with two coordinates in space to generate the curved path. If the coordinates can be fitted into a curved line in space, and it is within Tello's flight range (Curve radius within 0.5 to 10m), Tello will execute the curve command. Otherwise, Tello will not fly at all.

Your goal is to control Tello to follow the plant's lowest orbit and reach the farthest end of it.

1. Place your Tello on a flat surface.
2. Make sure the battery level is above 20%.
3. Take off and fly a curve line via point (x1:100, y1:100, z1:0) and (x2:200, y2:0, z2:0).
4. Land after Tello reach the point.
5. Tap **Run My Code**.

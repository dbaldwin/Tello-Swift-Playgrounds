**Goal:** Use Swift commands to adjust Tello's speed.

Tello flies at full speed by default. But sometimes you may want to fly slower, especially when you are performing an inspection.

Try to use `setSpeed(cms: UInt)` to adjust Tello's flying speed. You can adjust the speed from 1cm/s to 100cm/s.


1. Place your Tello on a flat surface.
2. Make sure the battery level is above 20%.
3. After takeoff, fly 180 cm forward and turn 180 degrees.
4. Set the speed to 50% and fly 180 cm forward.
5. Turn 180 degrees and land.
6. Tap **Run My Code**.

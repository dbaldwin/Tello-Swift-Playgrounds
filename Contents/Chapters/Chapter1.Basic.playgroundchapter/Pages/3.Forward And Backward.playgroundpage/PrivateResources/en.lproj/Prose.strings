**Goal:** Use Swift commands to tell Tello to fly forward and backward.

Just like telling Tello to fly up and down, you can tell Tello to fly forward and backward by using `flyForward(cm: UInt)` and `flyBackward(cm: UInt)`.

Before you run the code, make sure you have enough distance for Tello to execute your command.

1. Place your Tello on a flat surface.
2. Make sure the battery level is above 20%.
3. Fly 100cm forward after takeoff.
4. Fly 100cm backward and then land.
5. Tap **Run My Code**.

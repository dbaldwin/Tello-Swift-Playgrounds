**Goal:** Use Swift command to fly Tello from one galaxy to another.

You are now ready for the galaxy jump.  To do so you will need to use the `transit(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int, pad1: Int, pad2: Int)` command. This command will control Tello to jump from Galaxy 1 to Galaxy 2, where Galaxy 2 is on the coordinates (x, y, z) of Galaxy 1, and z is the height of Tello when it reaches Galaxy 2.

To make Tello fly to the new galaxy, you need to use the Mission Pads we provided and align them as we've instructed.

1. Put **Two** Mission Pads on a flat surface.
2. Place your Tello on the Mission Pad 1. It is better to put near the center of it.
3. Make sure the battery level is above 20%.
4. check the Galaxy ID before and after you jump.
5. Enter `transit(x: 100, y: 0, z: 100, pad1: Int, pad2: Int)`. Fill in pad1 and pad2 parameter with the actual ID of your Mission Pads.
6. Tap **Run My Code**.

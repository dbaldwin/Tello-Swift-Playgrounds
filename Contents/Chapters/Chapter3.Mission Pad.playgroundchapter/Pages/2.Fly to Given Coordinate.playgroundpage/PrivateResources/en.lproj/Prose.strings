**Goal:** Use Swift commands to fly Tello to the coordinate of the galaxy.

By knowing the Galaxy ID, and the Coordinates of the destination, you can program Tello to fly directly to it. Here we use a slightly different version of `flyLine(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int, pad: Int)`. By giving the Galaxy ID in the end, Tello will fly in the Mission Pad's coordinate system, instead of flying in its own coordinates. Without a Mission Pad under it, Tello's current coordinate will always reset to 0 when it's hovering.

To make Tello fly to the coordinates in the galaxy, you need to use the Mission Pad we provided. Remember to fly within the Mission Pad's recommended range.

1. Put a Mission Pad on a flat surface.
2. Place your Tello on the Mission Pad. It is better to put near the center of it.
3. Make sure the battery level is above 20%.
4. A variable padId is introduced  to represent the Galaxy ID. Assign function `getPadID()` to padId after takeoff.
5. Fly a straight line to point (x: 30, y: 0, z: 100, pad: padId). You can see we've filled in padId for you. 
6. Land after it's done.
7. Tap **Run My Code**.

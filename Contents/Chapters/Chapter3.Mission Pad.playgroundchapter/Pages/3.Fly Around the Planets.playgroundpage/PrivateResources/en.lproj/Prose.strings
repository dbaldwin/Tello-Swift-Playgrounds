**Challenge:** Control Tello to fly around the galaxy with the given coordinates.

Before you go to the new galaxy, you need to practice the coordinate flying. You will be given 4 sets of coordinates, which represent the 4 corners of a square area, and you should pass through them in a single flight.

The coordinates are :
* C1: (x: -30, y: 30, z: 100)
* C2: (x: -30, y: -30, z: 100)
* C3: (x: 30, y: -30, z: 100)
* C4: (x: 30, y: 30, z: 100)

* Callout(Tips):
  1. Remember to use the Mission Pad, and use command to get its ID.
  2. Define a variable padId, and assign the Mission Pad's ID to it.
  3. Use `flyLine(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int, pad: Int)` command. Remember to change the pad parameter.
  4. After takeoff, fly to C1 which is the lower left corner first.

**Challenge:** Control Tello to fly back from the new galaxy.

Now you are in the new galaxy. The Wi-Fi transmission signal is still strong, which is a good sign.

* Callout(Tips):
  1. Remember to use the Mission Pads and check their ID.
  2. Use `transit(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int, pad1: Int, pad2: Int)` command and set the correct parameters.
